When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share my work with others, to save my project in case my computer crashes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I do not want my remote repository contain partial set of commits of my project. The full commit to the remote repository must be logical as well.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: clone someone's repository into GitHub
Clone: copy a remote repository into my local working space
Branch: label to a set of commits. Parallel development of the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To compare and update our local branch offline to be able to merge to the remote one.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Sending zip files and making diff over the files. But intensive coordination would be required.
Git and GgitHub makes this easier.
