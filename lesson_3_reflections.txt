When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share my work with others, to save my project in case my computer crashes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I do not want my remote repository contain partial set of commits of my project. The full commit to the remote repository must be logical as well.
