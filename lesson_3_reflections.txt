When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share my work with others, to save my project in case my computer crashes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I do not want my remote repository contain partial set of commits of my project. The full commit to the remote repository must be logical as well.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: clone someone's repository into GitHub
Clone: copy a remote repository into my local working space
Branch: label to a set of commits. Parallel development of the master branch.
